Selected System: 

Qalb+: A platform facilitating the search for nearby healthcare providers and doctors, considering specialties and accepted insurance types. 

Business Requirements: 

Overall, the main purpose of the Qalb+ system is to address the challenge faced by patients in efficiently finding suitable healthcare providers based on their location, specialty, and insurance coverage. The approach we are looking at, is to develop a system that is not completely user-resource dependent and is lightweight enough to be operated off mobile devices. This system will allow for top rated, real-time search results, file sharing, messaging, and high quality responses from customer service.
